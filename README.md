# Intro

Hot rolled steel bars have to cutted in certain customer needed lenght. Different cutting disc types can be applied for this process. We are going to try - by means of ANOVA - to figure out, which of three selected cutting discs have the best efficiency / lifetime.

The effect of following parameters (x-values) will be investigate on the efficiency (y-value) of cutting discs:

-    Disc type

-   Steel bar temperature

-   Circumferential speed of cutting machine

-   Feed speed of cutting machine

-   Carbon content of the steel bars

-   Area of the steel bars

-   Diameter of the steel bars

Above are R/RStudio/Quarto files to reproduce the ANOVA by yourself.

I have also create a website, which shows the results of ANOVA (at the top right of this page, have a look).
