We are going to try - by means of ANOVA - to figure out, which of three selected cutting discs have the best efficiency / lifetime.\nThe effect of following parameters (x-values) will be investigate on the efficiency (y-value) of cutting discs:\n\nDisc type\nSteel bar temperature\nCircumferential speed of cutting machine\nFeed speed of cutting machine\nCarbon content of the steel bars\nArea of the steel bars\nDiameter of the steel bars"
