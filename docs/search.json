    "text": "Hot rolled steel bars must be cutted in certain customer needed length. Different cutting disc types can be applied for this process. We are going to - by means of ANalysisis Of VAriances - figure out, which of three selected cutting discs have the best efficiency respectively the biggest inefficiency. The inefficiency is measured by the product of price times wear and tear of cutting discs.\nThe effect of following independent variables / process parameters (x-values) will be investigated on the inefficiency respectively on the product of price times wear and tear (y-value, dependent) of cutting discs:\n\nDisc type\nSteel bar temperature\nCircumferential speed of cutting machine\nFeed speed of cutting machine\nCarbon content of the steel bars\nArea of the steel bars\nDiameter of the steel bars"

    "text": "Visualize post-hoc results\nIn Figure 3 you can read at the x-axis the mean differences of inefficiency with confidence intervals of cutting discs and at the y-axis you can see to which disc types / pairs this are related.\nFor instance is the mean differences of inefficiency between cutting disc C and B -8540€mm (mean inefficiency C minus mean efficiency B) and there confidence interval doesn’t include zero (black dashed line at x-axis).\nNone of the confidence intervals overlaps the value of zero at the x-axis; this means significant differences of the cutting discs regarding the inefficiency.\nAs we see in the boxplot before (Figure 1), the cutting disc B is the most inefficient disc type! The most efficient cutting disc is C!\nBut which of our seven independent variables / parameters has the most effect on the inefficiency of the cutting discs?
